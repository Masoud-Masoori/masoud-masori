# Hi, I'm Masoud! 👋  You can call me Mas 
🏗️ **Civil Engineer Turned ML Consultant & Entrepreneur**  

### 🌟 My Journey  

With a master’s degree in civil engineering, I reached the top of that field, but my lifelong obsession with tech (dating back to the DOS and NC era!) never faded. Life took a turn when I immigrated to Canada in 2022. Starting from scratch, I got first interview and landed my first tech role in canada at IvyTech, pivoted back to school in my 40, and now thrive as an **entrepreneur** and **Machine Learning Consultant**. 


 **Never stop reinventing.**
