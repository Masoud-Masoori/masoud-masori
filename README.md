# Hi, I'm Masoud! 👋 You can call me Mas.
🏗️ **Civil Engineer Turned ML Consultant & Entrepreneur**

### 🌟 My Journey

With a master’s degree in civil engineering, I reached the top of that field, but my lifelong obsession with tech (dating back to the DOS and NC era!) never faded. Life took a turn when I immigrated to Canada in 2022. Starting from scratch, I got my first interview and landed my first tech role in Canada at IvyTech, pivoted back to school in my 40s, and now thrive as an **entrepreneur** and **Machine Learning Consultant**.


 **Never stop reinventing.**
